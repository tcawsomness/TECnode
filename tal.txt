     <p>Do you know what today’s world really needs? 

In this presentation you will understand that TODAY’S CARS ARE POLLUTING THE ENVIRONMENT.  

So that’s where TECnode comes in!    This company will forever change the world because, we will make cars that work on magnets. Basically  instead of roads with tar there will be roads with magnets so

Basically the roads will have magnets that push the cars  also the cars will travel in glass tunnels with a long + magnet to hold the car down, In order to turn in the direction that you want there would be solar panels to produce energy so you could turn. Buy TECnode cars to  reduce the amount of fossil fuels used in the world. Our cars will be special because many companies make cars that run  on fossil fuels. Plus... People would not have to drive that much.</p>
